# Next Simple Store

This is a simple store app where the user can register customers, products and then order some of those products. The main goal of the app is to test NextJS as a backend using tRPC and Prisma.

## Tools

The main tools used for this project are:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/): One of the best React frameworks with support for SSR and lambda.
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/): Typesafe API framework with a very nice integration with Next.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): Typesafe ORM that makes migrations really easy.

Supporting tools:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): JS linter which I can't live without.
- [Formik](https://formik.org/): Open source form library with a very nice hook API.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/pt-BR/): JS testing framework which I like the most.
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/): Pretty cool testing utilities to use with Jest for testing react componentes. Helps make your tests more user-interaction-oriented.
- [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/): A state management library for React made by the React devs. Easy to use.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/): One of the nicest CSS-in-JS solutions for styling your app.
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup): Nice schema validator that integrates smoothly with formik. Has an easy way to declare validation error messages, so it's used for the form validations.
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod): A typesafe schema validation, pretty much like Yup, but with better type inference. Used with tRPC to infer and validate the route inputs.
